# Digital Transforamation Case Study
This is to share a group project on a case study of a SIRI (Singapore Industry Readiness Index) assessment report on an aviation component MRO factory in Singapore. For group project, we are asked to pick a digital transforamation(DT) related topic by ourselves. The topic can be a published digital tarnsformation by a company, a goverment initiative project or a use case of a company DT program etc. We shall give our recommendation to analyse what are the do and don't of the DT, and what shall be the proposed recommendations. While most of other group choosed the corporate or gorverment macro level DT reports, our group preferred a granular scale level DT as is will be more to the actual actions to most of working levels and learn the most of execution of DT at our work place.
