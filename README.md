# Digital Transformation Case Study
This is to share a group project on a case study of a [SIRI (Smart Industry Readiness Index)](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/advanced-manufacturing-release.html) assessment report on an aviation component MRO factory in Singapore. For group project, we are asked to pick a digital transformation(DT) related topic by ourselves. The topic can be a published digital transformation by a company, a government initiative project or a use case of a company DT program etc. We shall give our recommendation to analyse what are the do and don't of the DT, and what shall be the proposed recommendations. While most of other groups choose the corporate or government macro level DT reports as their topics, our group preferred a granular scale level DT as is will be more to the actual actions to most of working levels and learn the most of execution of DT at our work place.
